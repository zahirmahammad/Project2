## Dijkstra Algorithm - Path Planning [Pygame]

Python Libraries used - numpy, pygame, heapq, time

1) Run the single python file given

2) Input valid x,y coordinates of start and goal node -> Consider inputting in terms of index 

3) Djistra algorithm is implemented and a pygame window will open up showing the nodes explored and optimal path

Clearance of 5 is given, however, input of 5 is considered since, pygame considers 0 to 4 as 5 units
